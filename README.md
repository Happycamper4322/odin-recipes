<h1>Restraunt project</h1>

<p> Below you will find all my notes and what I have learned and improved upon during the course of my first website project in TOP.</p>
<p> This assignment reinforce the basic lessons already taught. It has also forced me to become more comfortable with GIT commands. I challenged myself by only using the CL to move images to different files and correct mistakes, such as renaming files or pictures. </p>
<p> It has inspired me to learn more so I can create a Firehouse cook book website, which was not why I started this journey. I just really enjoyed this assignment.</p>
